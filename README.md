# ToggleVisibilityOnButtonClick
ToggleVisibilityOnButtonClick is a JavaScript script that adds interactivity to your web page by allowing you to toggle the visibility of an element when a button is clicked.

This script uses the `click` event on a button with ID `toggleButton`. On each click, it checks the current display style of the element with id `elementToToggle`. If the element is visible (its `display` style is not `'none'`), then the script hides it by setting the `display` style to `'none'`. If the element is hidden, the script displays it by setting the `display` style to `'block'`.

This script can be easily integrated into your web projects to create interfaces with dynamic elements that can be toggled by the user using a button.
